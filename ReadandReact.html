	<p>First of the life all these slave face is completely terrible. These Southerners decided to jail African Americans for no reason and work them to death. They used this as a replacement for slave labor, but what these African Americans experienced is far worse.</p>
	<p>The slaves worked in very hot weather and when they passed out from heat stroke, they were brought into the shade and drenched with buckets of water then got put back to work. This wokr put a lot of strain on these people. They got no break. Since they were worked so hard they lived a lot shorter.</p>
